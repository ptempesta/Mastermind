# Mastermind

This is a short group project completed in the span of a couple weeks in February 2018 as a warm-up project for a class titled
CS 205 - Software Engineering. The program simulates the board game Mastermind with numbers in place to represent colored pegs. I wrote
the code for this project in collaboration with two other students, Ishan Verma and Dean Wertz. I contributed primarily to the guess.cpp
file by creating logic to handle string inputs, generate hints, and compare strings to count black and white keys. I also took charge of
general error handling throughout the program.
